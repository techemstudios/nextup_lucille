# 10/4
  # Had students from Monday's class as well as new ones
  # quick review of monday's content
  # each created new folders
  # Started to create simple interactive calculator python program
    # ended with code blocks: 1st condition statment (if user enetered "+")


# 10/16
    # finished calculator (started last week --ended with first condition block)
    # implemented the turtle module


# 10/18
    # Turtle Graphics Intro
    # make a right angle
    # for and while loops

# 10/23
  # Binary number review
    # focus on 0 and 1 meaning
  # Gates intro
    # AND, OR, NOT
      # how to represent: diagram, truth table, boolean
  # Simple calculator with turtle
  

# 10/30
  # pygame: pacman


# 11/1
  # simple command response program
    # create additional commands, handle the new command(s) with new condition(s)
      # more multi-way decision patterns
  # pacman.py contest


# 11/8
  # Simple conditional program (rollercoaster.py)
  # Binary Search Tree
    # how computer search through sorted lists efficiently
    # introduced with 'unplugged' random number game: pick number between 1 and 100
      # class guessed randomly
      # ask: what if first guessed a number in the middle of the range? Then again, and so on until guess is correct.
    # put binary search tree on whiteboard (range: 1 - 15), explaining how it works; nodes, parents,
    # less than, search left side of parent branch; greater than, search right side of parent branch
  # put random number game into a py program
    # have class figure out on their own how to structure the conditional statements
